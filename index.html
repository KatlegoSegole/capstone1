    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I picked up my first business book by Robert Kiyosaki
        from our school library and it absolutely changed my life. From that moment on 
        I have always been intrigued by business, in its totality. The fun, the challenges, 
        the barriers, and everything in between. It is my absolute dream to one day own a tech company 
        but of course, everyone says that. So i'll just have to put in the work and maybe oneday I can write a book
        about how to excel in tech and business.
